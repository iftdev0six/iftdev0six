> _"I write code that compiles on the first try... then immediately regret pushing it."_ 😅

Welcome to my little corner of GitHub — where bugs fear me (eventually), commits are meaningful (sometimes), and features go from TODO to DONE (miraculously).

## 🧠 About Me

```javascript
const iftekhar = {
  title: "Software Engineer",
  speciality: ["Backend", "System Design", "API Crafting", "Bug Whispering"],
  techStack: ["Node.js", "Express", "MongoDB", "PostgreSQL", "Prisma", "JavaScript", "React"],
  currentFocus: "Building scalable backend systems, leveling up frontend kung fu",
  funFact: "I speak fluent sarcasm and occasional binary 🧾",
}
```

## 🏗️ Projects That Make Me Look Cool

- 🧾 **BackendBoard** – A forum like Reddit/Quora with categories, user management, and JWT auth
- 💸 **Expense Tracker** – Because my expenses are scarier than my code
- ⚙️ **Multiservices Backend** – Complex systems made simple (kinda like IKEA furniture… with a manual)

🧠 Keep learning.  
🔥 Keep building.  
😎 And push like nobody’s watching.
