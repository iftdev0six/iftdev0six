## 🪄 The Developer Life

```
Me: I’ll fix just one small bug...
Also Me: Rewrites the whole project at 3AM 😵‍💫
```

```
if (sad === true) {
    sad = false;
    console.log("Coding started. Sadness gone.");
}
```

## 🎬 My Life in Frames

🎯 `git init`  
⏳ 10 mins later: `git commit -m "final FINAL fix"`  
🔥 1 hour later: `git reset --hard HEAD~1`  
🤯 Next day: `why is it not workingggg`

---

## ⌛ Daily Routine

🛌 Wake up  
🥱 Think about gym  
🧑‍💻 Open VS Code  
😵‍💫 Forget why I opened VS Code  
🔍 Spend 3 hours debugging  
💡 Realize it was a typo  
🧘 Accept my fate  
🍽 Eat. Pray. Code. Repeat.

👵 Mom: "Internet not working"  
🧑 Me: "Did you restart the router?"  
👵 Mom: *Unplugs fridge*  
💀 Me: "Close enough."
